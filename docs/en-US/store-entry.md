The precision app for perfect espresso extraction

Coffee Shot Timer was built specifically for espresso machine enthusiasts who want to systematically take their brewing skills to the next level. The app combines intelligent timing with detailed data capture to help you achieve consistent, dialed-in espresso extractions.

Brew ratio tracking: Track coffee input and espresso output through intuitive sliders that support single-shot baskets (down to 5g). The app automatically calculates your brew ratio and shows you when you're hitting the sweet spot.

Smart bean management: Manage your coffee beans with roast dates and automatic freshness indicators. Attach photos of bean packages for easier re-purchasing. The app lets you know when beans are still too fresh or past their prime.

Comprehensive shot logging: Record grinder settings, extraction times, and tasting notes. Every shot is saved with all relevant parameters - so you'll never forget a successful setup again.

Analysis and optimization: Visualize your brewing patterns over time and spot trends. The history feature helps you reproduce and develop successful settings with consistent shot analysis.

Equipment setup: Configure your grinder scale range to tailor the app to your specific equipment and get relevant guidance for your setup.
