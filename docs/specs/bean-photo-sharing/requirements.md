# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Milestone 1 of the Bean Photo & Sharing feature: Bean Photo Capture & Storage. This milestone focuses on enabling users to take photos of their coffee bean packages and store them alongside their bean records for visual identification and memory aid. The feature integrates seamlessly into the existing bean management workflow while maintaining the app's offline-first approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want to take photos of my bean packages during bean creation, so that I can visually identify the beans when shopping or browsing my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new bean THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add photos during the creation flow
2. WHEN the user selects "Add Photo" THEN the system SHALL present camera capture and gallery selection options
3. WHEN the user takes a photo with the camera THEN the system SHALL capture the image and display a preview for confirmation
4. WHEN the user confirms the photo THEN the system SHALL compress and store the image locally
5. WHEN the user saves the bean THEN the system SHALL associate the captured photo with the bean record

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want to add a photo to existing beans in my collection, so that I can enhance my bean records with visual information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an existing bean's details THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add or edit the bean photo
2. WHEN the user selects "Add Photo" from bean details THEN the system SHALL present camera capture and gallery selection options
3. WHEN the user adds a photo to an existing bean THEN the system SHALL update the bean record with the new photo
4. WHEN a bean already has a photo AND the user adds a new photo THEN the system SHALL replace the existing photo

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want to view the photo of my bean in the bean details screen, so that I can quickly identify and remember specific beans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a bean with a photo THEN the system SHALL display the photo prominently in the bean details view
2. WHEN a bean has no photo THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder or empty state
3. WHEN the user taps on a photo THEN the system SHALL display the photo in full-screen view with zoom capability
4. WHEN viewing the photo THEN the system SHALL load the image efficiently without blocking the UI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want to replace or delete the photo from my bean record, so that I can keep my visual library accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a bean with a photo THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit or delete the photo
2. WHEN the user selects "Delete Photo" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before removing the photo
3. WHEN the user confirms photo deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the photo from storage and update the bean record
4. WHEN the user selects "Replace Photo" THEN the system SHALL allow capturing a new photo to replace the existing one
5. WHEN replacing a photo THEN the system SHALL remove the old photo from storage after successful replacement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want the app to handle camera permissions gracefully, so that I can use photo features without confusion or app crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first attempts to use camera features THEN the system SHALL request camera permission with clear explanation
2. WHEN camera permission is denied THEN the system SHALL provide alternative options (gallery selection) and explain the limitation
3. WHEN camera permission is granted THEN the system SHALL enable full camera functionality for photo capture
4. WHEN camera is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to gallery selection only
5. IF camera permission is later revoked THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want my bean photos to be stored efficiently, so that they don't consume excessive device storage or impact app performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is captured or selected THEN the system SHALL compress the image to optimize storage size
2. WHEN storing photos THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient quality for identification purposes
3. WHEN the app starts THEN photo loading SHALL NOT significantly impact app startup time
4. WHEN viewing multiple beans with photos THEN the system SHALL load thumbnail images efficiently for each bean
5. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL handle storage errors gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want to use photo features without internet connection, so that I can manage my bean photos anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN all photo capture and storage features SHALL work normally
2. WHEN the device is offline THEN photo viewing and editing SHALL work without internet dependency
3. WHEN photos are stored THEN they SHALL be saved to local device storage
4. WHEN the app is used offline THEN photo features SHALL NOT require network connectivity
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN existing photo functionality SHALL continue working unchanged

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a coffee enthusiast, I want photo features to integrate seamlessly with the existing bean management UI, so that adding photos feels natural and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in bean creation flow THEN photo options SHALL be presented at an appropriate point in the workflow
2. WHEN viewing bean details THEN the photo SHALL be displayed using consistent app styling and spacing
3. WHEN using photo features THEN UI elements SHALL follow the app's Material 3 design system
4. WHEN photo operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN photo operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback to the user
6. WHEN using photo features THEN text SHALL be translated to the system language correctly
