# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a hidden debug dialog to the Record Shot screen that provides testing and debugging utilities for developers. The dialog is activated by tapping the "Record Shot" header text five times in succession and contains buttons for database management operations. This feature is designed to help developers create screenshots for the Play Store and test the application with realistic data, while ensuring it's only available in debug builds to prevent accidental use in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a hidden debug dialog by tapping the "Record Shot" header five times, so that I can access testing utilities without cluttering the main UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Record Shot" header text 5 times in succession THEN the system SHALL display a debug dialog
2. WHEN the user taps the header fewer than 5 times THEN the system SHALL NOT display the debug dialog
3. WHEN the user pauses for more than 3 seconds between taps THEN the system SHALL reset the tap counter to zero
4. WHEN the debug dialog is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that debug mode is active

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a button to fill the database with realistic test data, so that I can create high-quality screenshots for the Play Store and test the app with meaningful content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Fill Database" button THEN the system SHALL populate the database with realistic coffee beans, shots, and related data
2. WHEN the database is being populated THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
3. WHEN the population is complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message
4. WHEN the population fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
5. WHEN the database already contains data THEN the system SHALL add to existing data without duplicating entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a button to clear all database data, so that I can start with a clean slate for testing or screenshot creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Clear Database" button THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN the user confirms the clear operation THEN the system SHALL remove all data from the database
3. WHEN the database is being cleared THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. WHEN the clear operation is complete THEN the system SHALL display a success message
5. WHEN the clear operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug dialog to only be available in debug builds, so that end users cannot accidentally access testing utilities in the production app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built in debug mode THEN the system SHALL enable the debug dialog functionality
2. WHEN the app is built in release mode THEN the system SHALL completely exclude debug dialog code from the build
3. WHEN using conditional compilation THEN the system SHALL ensure no debug code is included in release builds
4. WHEN the debug functionality is disabled THEN tapping the header SHALL have no effect beyond normal UI interaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug dialog to have an intuitive interface, so that I can quickly perform testing operations without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the debug dialog is displayed THEN the system SHALL show clearly labeled buttons for each operation
2. WHEN the debug dialog is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to close the dialog without performing any operations
3. WHEN any operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable other buttons to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN the dialog is dismissed THEN the system SHALL reset the tap counter for the header
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL automatically dismiss the dialog after showing the result
