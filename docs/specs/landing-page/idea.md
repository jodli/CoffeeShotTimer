Tier 1: Easy Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)

These can be added quickly and immediately improve the site's value.

1.  A Public Roadmap & Changelog

    What it is: A page that outlines your plans for future features and lists the changes made in each new version of the app.

    Why it's valuable:

        Builds Trust: It shows users that the app is actively maintained and has a future.

        Manages Expectations: Users can see what's coming and feel more invested in the project.

        Reduces Feature Requests: If a user sees their desired feature is already on the roadmap, they won't need to ask for it.

    How to implement:

        Changelog: Create a changelog.html page and simply link to the "Releases" page of your GitHub repository. It's always up-to-date and requires zero extra work.

        Roadmap: Create a roadmap.html page with simple headings for "Planned," "In Progress," and "Considered." This can be a simple text list.

2.  A "Contribute" Page

    What it is: A page specifically for people who like your app and want to help.

    Why it's valuable:

        Leverages Your Community: As an open-source project, your users are your greatest asset. This page channels their energy productively.

        Improves Your App: You get better bug reports and feature ideas.

    How to implement: Create a contribute.html page with clear instructions:

        "Reporting a Bug": Link directly to the "Issues" tab of your GitHub repo with instructions to be as descriptive as possible.

        "Suggesting a Feature": Also direct them to the "Issues" tab, perhaps with a feature request template.

        "Contributing Code": A brief mention for developers to fork the repo and submit a pull request.

3.  A Press Kit

    What it is: A simple, one-stop page for anyone who might want to write about or feature your app (bloggers, YouTubers, etc.).

    Why it's valuable: It makes it incredibly easy for people to promote your app correctly. When a blogger is on a deadline, having everything they need in one place can be the difference between getting featured and being skipped.

    How to implement: Create a presskit.html page that includes:

        App Name: CoffeeShotTimer

        Developer: Your name/handle (jodli)

        Short Description: A one-paragraph summary of the app.

        Logo & Icon: High-resolution versions of the app icon (e.g., a 1024x1024 PNG).

        Screenshots: A zip file containing all the high-quality screenshots used on the landing page.

Tier 2: Content & Community Building (Higher Effort, Lasting Value)

These require more work but establish your authority and become valuable SEO assets.

4.  A "Brewing Guides" Blog

    What it is: A simple blog section with articles that help your target audience become better baristas.

    Why it's valuable:

        Massive SEO Boost: This is your #1 strategy for attracting new users through search engines. People searching for "how to dial in espresso" or "what is a good brew ratio" will find your website, learn something valuable, and then discover your app is the perfect tool to help them.

        Establishes Authority: You're no longer just an app developer; you're an expert in the coffee space.

    How to implement (statically):

        Create a /guides/ directory inside your /docs/ folder.

        Each article is a simple html file (e.g., how-to-dial-in.html).

        You can write them in Markdown and use a simple tool to convert them to HTML.

        Example Topics: "Understanding Brew Ratios," "A Beginner's Guide to Dialing In," "5 Common Espresso Mistakes and How to Fix Them."

5.  A "Barista's Toolkit" Resources Page

    What it is: A curated list of links to other great resources for home baristas.

    Why it's valuable: It's incredibly helpful for your users and shows that you're an active, collaborative member of the coffee community, not just someone trying to push their own app. It makes your site a destination.

    How to implement: Create a resources.html page with lists of links:

        Recommended YouTubers: (e.g., James Hoffmann, Lance Hedrick)

        Helpful Communities: (e.g., the r/espresso subreddit)

        Recommended Reading: (Links to well-known coffee blogs or books)
