# Visual Analytics & Intelligent Brewing Guidance

## Product Vision
Transform the overwhelming world of espresso metrics into an intuitive visual learning experience that guides users from their first shot to consistently great coffee. By combining simple taste feedback with intelligent recommendations, we make every user feel like they have a personal barista coach in their pocket.

## Problem Statement
Current analytics screens present users with walls of numbers that lack context and actionable guidance. Users, especially beginners, see metrics like "1:2.1 ratio" or "27s extraction" without understanding:
- Whether these numbers are good or bad
- What they mean for coffee taste
- What specific adjustments to make for improvement

Additionally, users rarely utilize note-taking features due to friction, missing valuable taste data that could drive personalized improvements.

## Solution Overview
Create a visual-first analytics system that:
1. **Simplifies complexity** through visual indicators and contextual zones
2. **Captures taste feedback** via frictionless one-tap buttons
3. **Provides actionable guidance** with specific grind adjustment recommendations
4. **Teaches through usage** by correlating metrics with taste outcomes
5. **Tracks improvement** with meaningful trendlines and progress indicators

## Core Principles
- **Visual over numerical**: Use colors, zones, and trends instead of raw numbers
- **Taste-driven**: Connect every metric to actual coffee flavor
- **Actionable insights**: Every analysis should suggest a specific next step
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as users advance
- **Learning through doing**: Teach extraction theory through practical experience

## Phase 1: Foundation - Taste Feedback & Smart Suggestions

### Epic 1: Configurable Grinder Settings
Enable precise grind adjustments tailored to each user's equipment.

**User Stories:**
- As a user with a stepless grinder, I want to configure step sizes of 0.1 so that I can make fine adjustments
- As a user with a stepped grinder, I want to set my grinder's actual step increments so that suggestions match my equipment
- As a user, I want to set minimum and maximum grind values so that suggestions stay within my grinder's range

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Grinder configuration includes: min value, max value, step size
- Step size supports common increments: 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, custom
- Validation prevents invalid configurations
- Existing 0.5 step data migrates smoothly

### Epic 2: One-Tap Taste Feedback
Replace unused notes field with frictionless taste capture.

**User Stories:**
- As a user finishing a shot, I want to record taste with one tap so that tracking becomes effortless
- As a beginner, I want to see pre-selected taste suggestions based on extraction time so that I learn correlations
- As a user, I want to skip taste feedback if I'm in a hurry without losing my shot data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Three primary taste buttons: Sour (ðŸ˜–), Perfect (ðŸ˜Š), Bitter (ðŸ˜£)
- Optional secondary buttons: Weak (ðŸ’§), Strong (ðŸ’ª)
- Pre-selection logic: <25s suggests Sour, 25-30s suggests Perfect, >30s suggests Bitter
- Taste can be edited later from shot history
- Visual feedback confirms selection

### Epic 3: Immediate Grind Adjustment Recommendations
Provide specific next-shot guidance based on taste feedback.

**User Stories:**
- As a user who just pulled a sour shot, I want to see exactly what grind setting to try next
- As a user, I want to understand why an adjustment is suggested so that I learn the relationships
- As a user, I want to save or dismiss suggestions so that I maintain control

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display current grind setting and suggested adjustment
- Show adjustment in user's configured step size
- Include explanation: "Under-extracted (Sour) - Shot ran 4s too fast"
- Adjustments follow rules: Sour â†’ finer, Bitter â†’ coarser
- Adjustment amount scales with extraction time deviation

### Epic 4: Persistent Next-Shot Guidance
Make recommendations visible and accessible for the next brewing session.

**User Stories:**
- As a user starting my morning routine, I want to see yesterday's suggestion prominently
- As a user, I want to confirm whether I followed the suggestion so the app can learn
- As a user switching between beans, I want bean-specific suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Home screen card shows: suggested grind, dose, expected time range
- Based on most recent shot with taste feedback
- Includes context: "Based on: Last shot was sour (24.5s)"
- Updates when user records new shot
- Persists across app sessions

- Highlight: "Trending 3s fast - try grinding finer"

### Epic 7: Taste-to-Metrics Correlation
Connect taste feedback to brewing parameters for learning.

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I want to see what extraction times produce balanced shots for me
- As a beginner, I want to understand why my coffee tastes sour or bitter
- As a user, I want personalized ranges based on my taste preferences

## Technical Considerations

### Data Migration
- Existing grinder settings (0.5 steps) must migrate to new configurable system
- Historical shots without taste data remain valid
- Preserve all existing shot metrics and relationships

### Performance
- Trendline calculations should be efficient for 1000+ shots
- Visual elements must render smoothly on mid-range devices
- Consider pagination or windowing for large datasets

### Accessibility
- Taste buttons must be accessible via screen readers
- Color-coded elements need alternative indicators (patterns, labels)
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for all visual elements

---

## Future Considerations (Phase 3+)
- Environmental factor tracking (humidity, temperature)
- Multi-user household support with separate profiles
- Integration with smart scales and grinders
- AI-powered taste note analysis from optional text/voice input
- Community benchmarks and comparisons
- Roaster-specific brewing profiles

---

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Grinder configuration must be in place before adjustment recommendations
- Taste feedback system required before correlation analytics
- Bean management system must support profile tracking

### Risks
- **User skepticism**: Some users may not trust automated suggestions
  - *Mitigation*: Show confidence levels and success rates
- **Over-simplification**: Advanced users may find visual approach too basic
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain detailed view option
- **Incorrect correlations**: Early suggestions with limited data may be inaccurate
  - *Mitigation*: Require minimum data points before strong recommendations
