# Coffee Shot Timer - Product Overview

---

## What We're Building

**An intelligent brewing coach for espresso enthusiasts.**

Not a logbook. Not just a timer with notes. A coach that learns from your shots and guides you to consistently better coffee.

---

## The Problem

Espresso is hard to dial in. Traditional apps assume you know what to adjustâ€”they just help you record experiments. Most users don't want to log data, they want **better coffee**.

Existing solutions:

- **Digital notebooks** - Track but don't guide
- **Basic timers** - Time but don't teach
- **Analysis apps** - Show data but no actionable insights

**The gap:** No one helps you improve.

## Our Solution

### Intelligence-First Design

We don't just record your shotsâ€”we analyze them and tell you what to change.

**Traditional paradigm:** Manual adjustment â†’ Record â†’ Repeat  
**Our paradigm:** Record â†’ System analyzes â†’ Recommendation â†’ Apply

### How It Works

**Recording a shot (15 seconds):**

1. Open app â†’ Timer ready (grinder already set)
2. Start timer â†’ Watch extraction
3. Save shot

**Getting better (10 seconds):**

1. Taste feedback: [ðŸ˜– Sour] [ðŸ˜Š Perfect] [ðŸ˜£ Bitter]
2. System suggests: "Try grind 3.5 (finer by 0.2)"
3. Explains why: "Your shot ran too fast"
4. [Apply] or [Skip] â†’ Done

**Result:** 3-4 shots to dial in vs. 7-10 with trial-and-error.

## Core Principles

### 1. Guide, Don't Just Record

Every interaction helps you improve. The app is a coach, not a notebook.

### 2. Show What Matters Now

UI adapts to brewing phase:

- **During extraction:** Massive timer (only thing that matters)
- **After extraction:** Taste feedback and suggestions appear

### 3. Trust in Automation

- **System handles:** Analysis, correlations, recommendations
- **You handle:** Tasting, accepting/rejecting, decisions

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

- **Beginners:** Simple interface with clear guidance
- **Experts:** Advanced controls revealed when needed

### 5. Invisible Power

Most powerful features hidden until needed. Clean interface, powerful backend.

## Success Metrics

### What We Measure

- **Perfect shot rate:** % of shots you rate as perfect
- **Dial-in speed:** How many shots to get it dialed in
- **Suggestion adoption:** Do users trust our recommendations?
- **User confidence:** Qualitative feedback

### Expected Outcomes

- **40%+ perfect shots** (vs. 20% baseline)
- **3-4 shots to dial in** (vs. 7-10 manual)
- **60%+ suggestion adoption** (proves system trust)
- **4.5+ star rating** (user satisfaction)

## What We're NOT Building

**Out of scope:**

- Gamification (badges, streaks, challenges)
- Multi-brew methods (pour-over, French press)
- Recipe databases or guides
- Cloud-first architecture

**Why:** Focus on core value. Intelligence-first means smart guidance, not feature bloat.

---

## Why This Will Work

### The Market Gap

**Most apps:** Track data â†’ Users still struggle  
**Us:** Guide improvement â†’ Users make better coffee

### The Magic Moment

> "I told the app my shot was sour and it told me exactly how to fix it. Next shot was perfect!"

This creates viral word-of-mouth that data tracking never will.

### The Competitive Advantage

- Clean, focused interface vs. complex feature lists
- Actionable intelligence vs. passive data collection
- Guided improvement vs. trial-and-error experimentation
- Scalable: Add ML and community insights without UI complexity

### The Long-Term Vision

Once the intelligence foundation is built:

- ML-powered personalized recommendations
- Community insights ("90% prefer this setting with this bean")
- Equipment-specific optimization
- Integration with smart grinders/machines

Power grows invisibly. Interface stays clean.
