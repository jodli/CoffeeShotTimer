## Technology Stack

This is an Android application built with:

- **Kotlin** — primary programming language
- **Android Gradle Plugin** — build system
- **Hilt** — dependency injection
- **Room Database** — local data storage
- **Detekt** — static code analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Android SDK
- Gradle

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jodli/CoffeeShotTimer.git
cd CoffeeShotTimer
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

4. Run on a device or emulator:

```bash
./gradlew installDevDebug
```

### Code Quality & Static Analysis

The project uses **Detekt** for static code analysis to maintain code quality:

#### Running Detekt

```bash
# Run detekt analysis with Java 21
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk ./gradlew detekt

# Or with default Java (requires Java 21+)
./gradlew detekt
```

#### Detekt Reports

Detekt generates multiple report formats:

- **HTML Report**: `app/build/reports/detekt/detekt.html` - Human-readable report for local development
- **XML Report**: `app/build/reports/detekt/detekt.xml` - For CI/CD integration
- **SARIF Report**: `app/build/reports/detekt/detekt.sarif` - GitHub Security integration

#### Baseline Management

The project uses a baseline file to track existing issues and prevent regressions:

```bash
# Update the baseline (suppresses existing issues)
./gradlew detektBaseline
```

**Note**: Only regenerate the baseline when necessary, as it suppresses existing issues. New code should meet quality standards without baseline suppression.

### Release Build

The project includes configuration for release builds. A pre-built release is available in `app/release/app-release.aab`.

## Project Structure

```
app/src/main/           # Main application source code
app/src/test/           # Unit tests
app/src/androidTest/    # Instrumentation tests
docs/                   # Documentation and screenshots
gradle/                 # Gradle configuration
```

## Development Workflow

This project uses an automated CI/CD pipeline with three deployment tracks and integrated code quality checks:

### 🛠️ Code Quality Pipeline

Every pull request and push triggers:

1. **Build & Test**: Compilation and unit tests
2. **Android Lint**: Built-in Android code analysis
3. **Detekt Analysis**: Kotlin static code analysis with SARIF upload to GitHub Security

Code quality reports are available as:

- GitHub Actions artifacts (HTML reports)
- GitHub Security tab (vulnerabilities and code quality issues)
- PR checks (blocking on failure)

### 🎯 Deployment Tracks

| Trigger                      | Track               | Audience          | Purpose            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Manual dispatch (any branch) | Internal            | Development team  | Test risky changes |
| Push to `main` (app changes) | Beta (Open Testing) | Public beta users | Public testing     |
| Version tag (`v*`)           | Production          | All users         | Live releases      |
