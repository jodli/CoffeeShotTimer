# Feature Idea: Enhanced 5-Tab Navigation Structure

## Rough Concept
Evolve the current 3-tab bottom navigation (Record Shot, History, Bean Management) into a more scalable 5-tab structure: Home, Beans, History, Insights, and More. This creates dedicated spaces for current and planned features while improving the overall user experience and app discoverability.

## Why This Would Be Useful
- **Better feature organization**: Logical grouping of functionality by user intent rather than technical structure
- **Improved discoverability**: Features like shot analysis and brewing insights get dedicated, prominent spaces
- **Scalability for future features**: The "More" tab and modular structure can accommodate new features without cramping
- **Enhanced user flow**: Home screen becomes a dashboard with quick actions and recent activity overview
- **Reduced navigation friction**: Most common actions accessible from the home screen without deep navigation

## Proposed Navigation Structure

### Home Tab
- **Primary purpose**: Quick shot recording + dashboard overview
- **Content**: Current bean selection, large timer, weight inputs, recent shots summary, quick actions
- **Benefits**: Combines most frequent actions in one place, provides context about recent brewing activity

### Beans Tab  
- **Primary purpose**: Comprehensive bean management
- **Content**: Current bean management functionality + future photo features
- **Benefits**: Dedicated space for bean-related features, room for photo integration and enhanced bean profiles

### History Tab
- **Primary purpose**: Shot history and filtering
- **Content**: Current shot history functionality with enhanced filtering and search
- **Benefits**: Maintains current functionality while providing space for improved filtering and analysis tools

### Insights Tab
- **Primary purpose**: Analytics and brewing advice
- **Content**: Shot statistics, trends, intelligent brewing advisor, success metrics
- **Benefits**: Makes analysis features more discoverable, dedicated space for the planned intelligent brewing advisor

### More Tab
- **Primary purpose**: Settings and additional features
- **Content**: App settings, cloud sync, sharing features, help, about
- **Benefits**: Expandable section for future features without cluttering main navigation

## Key Benefits

### For Current Users
- **Faster workflow**: Most common actions (select bean, record shot, check recent activity) available from home
- **Better context**: See brewing trends and recent activity without navigating away
- **Improved feature discovery**: Analytics and insights get prominent placement

### For Future Features
- **Natural integration points**: Intelligent brewing advisor fits perfectly in Insights tab
- **Photo features**: Bean photos integrate seamlessly into enhanced Beans tab
- **Cloud sync and sharing**: Logical placement in More tab
- **Social features**: Could expand Insights or More tabs as needed

### For App Architecture
- **Modular design**: Each tab becomes a focused module with clear responsibilities
- **Consistent patterns**: New features follow established navigation and UI patterns
- **Maintainable code**: Clear separation of concerns between different feature areas

## Implementation Considerations
- **Gradual migration**: Could implement new structure while maintaining current functionality
- **User familiarity**: Home tab would feel familiar to current "Record Shot" users
- **Performance**: Modular structure allows for better lazy loading and performance optimization
- **Accessibility**: Clear tab labels and consistent navigation patterns improve accessibility

## Notes
- Should maintain the coffee-focused design language and UI consistency guidelines
- Could start with 4 tabs (Home, Beans, History, More) and add Insights when intelligent brewing advisor is ready
- Home screen dashboard elements should be configurable or prioritized based on user behavior
- Navigation structure should work well on both phone and tablet form factors
- Consider onboarding flow to introduce users to the new navigation structure
