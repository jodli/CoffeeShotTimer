# Feature Idea: Beginner Onboarding Experience

## Rough Concept
Create an interactive onboarding experience that teaches espresso fundamentals to new users. Focus on the most critical knowledge gap: distinguishing between over-extraction (bitter) and under-extraction (sour), and knowing what to adjust for each.

## Why This Would Be Useful
- **Reduces intimidation**: Makes espresso brewing approachable for newcomers
- **Prevents common mistakes**: Teaches the crucial over/under-extraction distinction early
- **Builds confidence**: Users get clear direction instead of guessing what went wrong
- **Creates good habits**: Establishes systematic approach to brewing and tasting from the start
- **Reduces frustration**: Provides clear next steps when shots don't taste right

## Core Features

### Interactive Taste Training
- Simple sour vs bitter identification exercises
- Audio descriptions paired with visual examples
- "What does this taste like?" quiz with common descriptors

### First Shot Wizard

### Extraction Fundamentals

### Quick Reference Tools

- Progress tracking to show improvement over time

## Implementation Notes
