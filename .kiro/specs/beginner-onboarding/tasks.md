## Implementation Notes

### Development Sequence
Each user story builds incrementally:
1. **Story 1** establishes the foundation for detecting and routing first-time users
2. **Story 2** provides the educational introduction that users need
3. **Story 3** captures the essential grinder configuration that personalizes the experience
4. **Story 4** completes the first shot experience with celebration and transition

Offline support and error handling are integrated throughout each story where the functionality is implemented.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each task includes specific unit tests for components and logic
- **Integration Tests**: User stories include integration testing for complete flows
- **UI Tests**: Interactive components have dedicated UI testing requirements
- **End-to-End Tests**: Final story validates complete onboarding journey

### Quality Gates
- Each user story must be fully functional before proceeding to the next
- All tests must pass before considering a user story complete
- UI components must follow existing design system and accessibility standards
- Integration with existing app features must not break current functionality

### Rollback Strategy
- Each user story can be independently enabled/disabled via feature flags
- Onboarding can be bypassed entirely if issues arise
- Existing users are never affected by onboarding implementation
- Database migrations are reversible for safe rollback
