# Feature Idea: Intelligent Brewing Advisor

## Rough Concept
Enhance the existing shot analysis with intelligent brewing advice based on taste notes. When users enter descriptive words in the "Notes" section (like "sour", "bitter", "weak", "harsh"), the app would analyze the text and provide specific, actionable recommendations on how to improve the next shot.

## Why This Would Be Useful
- **Learning acceleration**: Helps users understand the connection between taste and brewing parameters
- **Personalized guidance**: Goes beyond generic shot analysis to address specific taste issues
- **Knowledge transfer**: Brings barista expertise to home brewers who might not know how to fix taste problems
- **Confidence building**: Users get specific next steps rather than guessing what to adjust
- **Progressive improvement**: Creates a feedback loop between tasting and brewing adjustments

## Notes
- Could use sentiment analysis or keyword matching to identify taste descriptors
- Should map taste issues to specific parameter adjustments (grind size, dose, time, temperature)
- Could learn from user patterns over time (if they consistently follow advice and improve)
- Should integrate with existing shot analysis recommendations
- Could include a taste vocabulary guide to help users describe what they're tasting
- Might benefit from a simple rating system alongside notes (1-5 stars for different aspects)
- Could suggest brewing parameter ranges based on detected taste issues
- Should handle multiple taste descriptors in one note ("bitter and weak")
- Could provide educational content about why certain adjustments help specific taste issues
