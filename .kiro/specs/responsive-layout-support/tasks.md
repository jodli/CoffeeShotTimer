## Implementation Notes

### Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Each task builds upon previous tasks and can be tested independently
- **Existing Component Preservation**: All tasks extend existing components rather than replacing them
- **Fallback Safety**: Every responsive enhancement includes graceful fallback to existing portrait phone layouts
- **Timer Accuracy Priority**: Timer state preservation is implemented early and validated throughout

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Configuration detection, spacing calculations, component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Screen rotation, state preservation, navigation consistency
- **UI Tests**: Layout validation, accessibility compliance, touch target verification
- **Manual Testing**: Real device testing across different screen sizes and orientations

### Quality Gates
- **Timer Accuracy**: Must be preserved across all configuration changes
- **Existing Functionality**: All existing features must work identically in responsive layouts
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Touch targets, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Smooth transitions under 300ms, no memory leaks during configuration changes
- **Design Consistency**: Coffee-themed design language maintained across all screen configurations
