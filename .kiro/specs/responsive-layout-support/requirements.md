2. WHEN rotating during an active timer session THEN the system SHALL preserve the exact elapsed time and continue counting
3. WHEN the timer state changes during rotation THEN the system SHALL maintain the correct timer state (running, paused, stopped)
4. WHEN rotation occurs during timing THEN the system SHALL preserve any recorded shot data or draft information
5. WHEN the timer completes during or after rotation THEN the system SHALL record the accurate final time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a home barista with wet or coffee-stained fingers, I want touch targets to remain at least 44dp in landscape mode, so that I can reliably interact with the app during brewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements have minimum 44dp touch targets
2. WHEN using landscape layouts THEN the system SHALL maintain the recommended 48dp+ touch targets for primary actions like timer controls
3. WHEN in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing between adjacent touch targets to prevent accidental taps
4. WHEN using tablet layouts THEN the system SHALL scale touch targets appropriately for the larger screen while maintaining accessibility standards
5. WHEN touch targets are displayed in landscape THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain easily accessible with thumb interaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a home barista using the main shot recording screen, I want an optimized landscape layout that makes efficient use of horizontal space, so that I can access all controls comfortably in landscape orientation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the shot recording screen in landscape THEN the system SHALL arrange timer and controls in a horizontal layout that utilizes available width
2. WHEN in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL position the timer prominently while keeping weight sliders and controls easily accessible
3. WHEN using landscape shot recording THEN the system SHALL maintain the large clickable timer functionality with appropriate sizing for the orientation
4. WHEN in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL ensure all shot recording fields remain visible without excessive scrolling
5. WHEN recording shots in landscape THEN the system SHALL preserve the intuitive workflow from bean selection through shot completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a home barista viewing shot history, I want landscape and tablet layouts that show more information efficiently, so that I can analyze my brewing data more effectively on larger screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing shot history in landscape THEN the system SHALL display more shots per screen or additional details per shot entry
2. WHEN using tablet layouts for shot history THEN the system SHALL consider side-by-side layouts with shot list and details panel
3. WHEN in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL maintain easy navigation between shots and filtering capabilities
4. WHEN viewing shot details in landscape THEN the system SHALL arrange information in columns or sections that use horizontal space effectively
5. WHEN using larger screens THEN the system SHALL display charts, graphs, or additional analytics where space permits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a home barista managing beans, I want responsive bean management layouts that work well in landscape and on tablets, so that I can efficiently manage my coffee inventory regardless of device orientation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing bean management in landscape THEN the system SHALL arrange bean cards in a grid or horizontal layout that maximizes screen usage
2. WHEN adding or editing beans in landscape THEN the system SHALL organize form fields efficiently across available horizontal space
3. WHEN using tablet layouts for bean management THEN the system SHALL consider showing bean list alongside bean details or editing forms
4. WHEN managing beans in landscape THEN the system SHALL maintain photo viewing and editing capabilities with appropriate sizing
5. WHEN using responsive bean layouts THEN the system SHALL preserve all functionality including photo capture and bean selection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a home barista using navigation, I want consistent navigation behavior across orientations and screen sizes, so that I can move through the app intuitively regardless of device configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app in landscape THEN the system SHALL maintain the same navigation structure and bottom navigation bar functionality
2. WHEN on tablet layouts THEN the system SHALL consider navigation patterns appropriate for larger screens (e.g., side navigation or persistent navigation)
3. WHEN rotating between orientations THEN the system SHALL preserve the current navigation state and screen position
4. WHEN using responsive navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure all navigation targets remain easily accessible
5. WHEN navigation elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy and interaction patterns

### Requirement 9
