# Feature Idea: Bean Photo & Sharing

## Rough Concept
Add photo capture functionality to bean management where users can take pictures of coffee bean packaging/bags. This helps with identification when shopping and enables social sharing where users can recommend beans to friends along with their preferred grind settings, brew ratios, and tasting notes.

## Why This Would Be Useful
- **Shopping assistance**: Visual reference makes it easier to find the same beans again in stores
- **Memory aid**: Users can remember which beans they liked without relying on text descriptions alone
- **Social discovery**: Friends can share bean recommendations with visual proof and brewing parameters
- **Community building**: Creates opportunities for coffee enthusiasts to connect and share experiences
- **Recipe sharing**: Users can share not just the bean but their successful brewing approach
- **Visual bean library**: Creates a personal collection of tried beans with photos

## Notes
- Photo capture should be integrated into bean creation/editing flow
- Could include multiple photos per bean (bag front, back, beans themselves)
- Sharing could be via standard sharing mechanisms (text, email, social media)
- Shared content might include: bean photo, name, roaster, user's rating, grind settings, brew ratio, taste notes
- Could create shareable "bean cards" with all the info formatted nicely
- Privacy considerations - users should control what gets shared
- Could integrate with existing social platforms or create in-app sharing
- Might want to compress/optimize photos for storage and sharing
- Could add barcode scanning for even easier bean identification
- Social features could expand to following friends, bean recommendations, etc.
- Could create a community database of beans with user contributions
