# Feature Idea: Cloud Sync Service

## Rough Concept
Add a cloud synchronization service that syncs all the user's recorded espresso shots. This would allow users to backup their shot history and restore it when switching devices, ensuring they never lose their brewing data.

## Why This Would Be Useful
- **Device continuity**: Users can switch between devices (phone, tablet, computer) and maintain their shot history
- **Data backup**: Protects against data loss from device failure, app reinstall, or accidental deletion
- **Multi-device usage**: Enables users to log shots from different devices and have a unified history
- **Peace of mind**: Users invest time in tracking their brewing progress and don't want to lose that data

## Notes
- Would need to consider authentication/user accounts
- Privacy and data security considerations for storing brewing data
- Sync conflict resolution (what happens if user logs shots on multiple devices while offline)
- Could integrate with popular cloud providers (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox) or build custom backend
- Should work offline-first with sync when connection is available
- Consider data export/import functionality as well
