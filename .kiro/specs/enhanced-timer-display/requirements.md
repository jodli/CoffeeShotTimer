# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An enhancement to the existing espresso shot timer in the Coffee Shot Timer app to provide better visual feedback and more appropriate time formatting for espresso extraction. The current timer displays time in MM:SS format and has a static circular progress indicator. This enhancement will add color-coded visual feedback based on extraction time quality and display seconds-only format for typical espresso shot durations.

**MAJOR ENHANCEMENT**: The implementation includes a revolutionary **Clickable Timer Component** that transforms the entire timer display into an interactive control, providing dramatically improved usability and accessibility through a massive increase in touch target size.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the timer to display only seconds during espresso extraction, so that I can quickly read the time without unnecessary minute formatting for short extractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extraction time is less than 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL display time in seconds format (e.g., "25s", "30s")
2. WHEN the extraction time is 60 seconds or more THEN the system SHALL display time in MM:SS format for longer extractions
3. WHEN the timer is running or paused THEN the system SHALL update the display format dynamically based on elapsed time
4. WHEN viewing shot history THEN the system SHALL display extraction times consistently using the appropriate format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the circular timer progress indicator to change colors based on extraction quality, so that I can quickly assess if my extraction timing is optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extraction time is less than 20 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in yellow color to indicate under-extraction risk
2. WHEN the extraction time is between 20-35 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in green color to indicate optimal extraction range
3. WHEN the extraction time is greater than 35 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in red color to indicate over-extraction risk
4. WHEN the timer is not running THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in a neutral gray color
5. WHEN the timer transitions between time ranges THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the color change

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want visual feedback that helps me understand extraction quality in real-time, so that I can make immediate adjustments during brewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time color feedback as the extraction progresses through different time ranges
2. WHEN the extraction reaches the optimal range (20s) THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual indication of entering the good zone
3. WHEN the extraction exceeds the optimal range (35s) THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual warning of potential over-extraction
4. WHEN viewing the timer THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animations and transitions for a polished user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the enhanced timer to work consistently across all screens where timing is displayed, so that I have a unified experience throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main shot recording screen THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced timer display with color coding and seconds formatting
2. WHEN viewing shot history with extraction times THEN the system SHALL use consistent time formatting (seconds for <60s, MM:SS for â‰¥60s)
3. WHEN viewing shot details THEN the system SHALL display extraction times using the same formatting rules
4. WHEN using the compact timer display THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate color coding while maintaining readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want a large, easily accessible timer button, so that I can quickly start and stop timing without looking away from my espresso machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the shot recording screen THEN the system SHALL display a timer start/stop button that is at least 80dp in diameter
2. WHEN the user needs to interact with the timer THEN the system SHALL provide a touch target that follows Material Design guidelines (minimum 48dp, recommended 80dp+)
3. WHEN the user taps the timer button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
4. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish the stop button visually from the start button

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want clear feedback when I interact with the timer, so that I know my tap was registered without having to look at the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the start button THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback (light impact)
2. WHEN the user taps the stop button THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback (medium impact)
3. WHEN the timer starts THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through button color/icon change
4. WHEN the timer stops THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through button color/icon change
5. WHEN the user taps the button THEN the system SHALL show a brief press animation or ripple effect

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the timer button to be visually prominent, so that I can easily locate it during the brewing process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the shot recording screen THEN the system SHALL display the timer button with high contrast colors
2. WHEN the timer is stopped THEN the system SHALL display a green start button with a play icon
3. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL display a red stop button with a stop icon
4. WHEN the user views the timer area THEN the system SHALL use colors that stand out from the background
5. WHEN the timer button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate elevation/shadow to make it appear raised

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the timer interface to work reliably under pressure, so that I don't miss timing my shots during the brewing process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user rapidly taps the timer button THEN the system SHALL prevent double-tap issues and respond to single taps only
2. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL continue timing accurately even if the user navigates away from the screen
3. WHEN the user returns to the shot recording screen THEN the system SHALL display the current timer state correctly
4. WHEN the timer button is pressed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate response without lag
5. WHEN the app is under memory pressure THEN the system SHALL maintain timer accuracy and button responsiveness

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a home barista with varying levels of dexterity, I want the entire timer to be clickable for start/stop control, so that I can easily interact with the timer even when my hands are busy or wet from brewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the extraction timer THEN the system SHALL allow me to tap anywhere on the 200dp circular timer to start/stop timing
2. WHEN I tap the timer area THEN the system SHALL provide immediate haptic feedback and visual response (within 100ms)
3. WHEN the timer is clickable THEN the system SHALL show subtle visual hints like "Tap to start" or "Tap to stop"
4. WHEN I need to reset the timer THEN the system SHALL provide a small reset button positioned elegantly outside the main timer area
5. WHEN I interact with the clickable timer THEN the system SHALL provide ripple effects and smooth animations for premium feel
6. WHEN using the clickable timer THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental multiple taps through debouncing (300ms)
7. WHEN I press and hold the timer THEN the system SHALL handle the interaction gracefully without triggering multiple actions
8. WHEN I use the clickable timer THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing timer functionality while providing the larger interaction area
9. WHEN the reset button appears THEN the system SHALL position it in the top-right area as a 40dp floating action button
10. WHEN I tap the reset button THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate haptic feedback and immediately reset the timer to 0:00
