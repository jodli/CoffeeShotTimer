# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An enhancement to the existing espresso shot timer in the Coffee Shot Timer app to provide better visual feedback and more appropriate time formatting for espresso extraction. The current timer displays time in MM:SS format and has a static circular progress indicator. This enhancement will add color-coded visual feedback based on extraction time quality and display seconds-only format for typical espresso shot durations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the timer to display only seconds during espresso extraction, so that I can quickly read the time without unnecessary minute formatting for short extractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extraction time is less than 60 seconds THEN the system SHALL display time in seconds format (e.g., "25s", "30s")
2. WHEN the extraction time is 60 seconds or more THEN the system SHALL display time in MM:SS format for longer extractions
3. WHEN the timer is running or paused THEN the system SHALL update the display format dynamically based on elapsed time
4. WHEN viewing shot history THEN the system SHALL display extraction times consistently using the appropriate format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the circular timer progress indicator to change colors based on extraction quality, so that I can quickly assess if my extraction timing is optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extraction time is less than 20 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in yellow color to indicate under-extraction risk
2. WHEN the extraction time is between 20-35 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in green color to indicate optimal extraction range
3. WHEN the extraction time is greater than 35 seconds THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in red color to indicate over-extraction risk
4. WHEN the timer is not running THEN the system SHALL display the progress indicator in a neutral gray color
5. WHEN the timer transitions between time ranges THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the color change

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want visual feedback that helps me understand extraction quality in real-time, so that I can make immediate adjustments during brewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time color feedback as the extraction progresses through different time ranges
2. WHEN the extraction reaches the optimal range (20s) THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual indication of entering the good zone
3. WHEN the extraction exceeds the optimal range (35s) THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual warning of potential over-extraction
4. WHEN viewing the timer THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth animations and transitions for a polished user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the enhanced timer to work consistently across all screens where timing is displayed, so that I have a unified experience throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main shot recording screen THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced timer display with color coding and seconds formatting
2. WHEN viewing shot history with extraction times THEN the system SHALL use consistent time formatting (seconds for <60s, MM:SS for â‰¥60s)
3. WHEN viewing shot details THEN the system SHALL display extraction times using the same formatting rules
4. WHEN using the compact timer display THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate color coding while maintaining readability
