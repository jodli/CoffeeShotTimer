# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An Android mobile application designed for home barista enthusiasts to track and analyze espresso shots. The app will help users record key brewing parameters including coffee input weight, output weight, extraction time, and grinder settings to enable precise dialing in of espresso preparation. The goal is to provide an intuitive interface for logging shots and analyzing brewing data to achieve consistent, high-quality espresso extraction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want to quickly record my espresso shot parameters, so that I can track my brewing consistency and make adjustments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a shot recording interface with input fields for coffee weight, output weight, extraction time, and grinder setting
2. WHEN the user enters shot data THEN the system SHALL validate that all required fields are completed before saving
3. WHEN the user saves a shot record THEN the system SHALL store the data with a timestamp
4. WHEN the user wants to record extraction time THEN the system SHALL provide a built-in timer functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want to view my shot history, so that I can analyze my brewing patterns and identify successful shots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to shot history THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of all recorded shots
2. WHEN the user views a shot entry THEN the system SHALL show coffee weight, output weight, extraction time, grinder setting, and timestamp
3. WHEN the user wants to find specific shots THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date range or grinder setting
4. WHEN the user selects a shot from history THEN the system SHALL display detailed shot information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want to manage different coffee beans, so that I can track shots separately for each bean type and maintain optimal settings per bean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens a new bag of beans THEN the system SHALL allow creating a new bean profile with name, roast date, and notes
2. WHEN the user records a shot THEN the system SHALL require selecting which bean is being used
3. WHEN the user switches between beans THEN the system SHALL remember the last grinder setting used for each bean type
4. WHEN the user views shot history THEN the system SHALL allow filtering shots by specific bean types
5. WHEN the user selects a bean THEN the system SHALL display the bean's roast date and days since roasting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want to track my grinder settings, so that I can correlate grind size with extraction results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user records a shot THEN the system SHALL require grinder setting input as a mandatory field
2. WHEN the user enters grinder settings THEN the system SHALL support both numeric and text-based grinder descriptions
3. WHEN the user views shot data THEN the system SHALL clearly display the grinder setting used for each shot
4. WHEN the user switches to a previously used bean THEN the system SHALL suggest the last successful grinder setting for that bean

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want to calculate brewing ratios automatically, so that I can quickly assess my extraction efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters coffee input and output weights THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate the brew ratio (e.g., 1:2.5)
2. WHEN the user views shot details THEN the system SHALL display the calculated brew ratio prominently
3. WHEN the user reviews shot history THEN the system SHALL show brew ratios for easy comparison

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want the app to work offline, so that I can record shots even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app without internet connection THEN the system SHALL function normally for recording and viewing shots
2. WHEN the user records shots offline THEN the system SHALL store data locally on the device
3. WHEN the user views shot history offline THEN the system SHALL display all previously recorded shots

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a home barista, I want an intuitive mobile interface, so that I can quickly record shots while brewing without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the app THEN the system SHALL provide large, touch-friendly input controls
2. WHEN the user is recording a shot THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of taps required to save data
3. WHEN the user needs to enter weights THEN the system SHALL provide numeric keypad input with decimal precision
4. WHEN the user is timing extraction THEN the system SHALL provide prominent start/stop timer controls
